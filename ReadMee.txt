This is a simple calculator that can perform arithmetic operations on integers and floating-point numbers. The calculator is implemented using Bison, a parser generator that can be used to generate parsers in C and C++.

To use the calculator, simply compile the code and run the executable. The calculator will then prompt you to enter a mathematical expression, which can include integers, floating-point numbers, and the following operators:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Factorial (!)
To input an integer, simply type the integer value. To input a floating-point number, type the value followed by a decimal point and the fractional part (e.g., 3.14). To perform an operation, enter the values and operators in the desired order.

Press enter after entering each line of input. The calculator will then print the result of the calculation.

Note that the calculator does not currently support parentheses or operator precedence. Additionally, division by zero will result in a runtime error.
